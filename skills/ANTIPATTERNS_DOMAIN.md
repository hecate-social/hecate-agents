# ANTIPATTERNS: Domain — Domain Modeling Mistakes

## 🔥 Parallel Domain Infrastructure

**Date:** 2026-02-04
**Origin:** hecate-daemon apprentice

### The Antipattern

Creating duplicate command/event/emitter infrastructure in a new domain when an existing domain already handles that concept.

**Example:** `serve_llm` created:
- `announce_llm_capability_v1` command
- `llm_capability_announced_v1` event
- `llm_capability_announced_v1_to_mesh` emitter
- `hecate.llm.announced` mesh topic

But `manage_capabilities` already has:
- `announce_capability_v1` command
- `capability_announced_v1` event
- `capability_announced_v1_to_mesh` emitter
- `hecate.capability.announced` mesh topic

LLM capabilities ARE just capabilities with `type = <<"llm">>`.

### The Rule

> **Don't duplicate domain concepts. Extend existing domains or use Process Managers to integrate.**

### The Solution: Process Managers

When Domain A needs to trigger behavior in Domain B:

```
Domain A (serve_llm)
    ↓ emits internal event (llm_model_detected_v1)

Process Manager (on_llm_model_detected_announce_capability)
    ↓ subscribes to Domain A events
    ↓ dispatches command to Domain B

Domain B (manage_capabilities)
    ↓ handles command normally
    ↓ existing infrastructure does the rest
```

**Loose coupling. Single source of truth. No duplication.**

## 🔥 Missing or Wrong "Birth" Event

**Date:** 2026-02-08
**Origin:** Venture/Division architecture discussion

### The Antipattern

Process/domain aggregates that don't have a clear "birth" event, or use wrong verbs:

| ❌ Wrong | Why |
|----------|-----|
| `project_created_v1` | CRUD — "created" says nothing about business intent |
| `division_started_v1` | Ambiguous — "started" could mean resumed, begun, etc. |
| `order_made_v1` | Weak — doesn't convey the initiation of a process |
| No birth event at all | Aggregate appears from nowhere |

### The Rule

> **Every process/domain aggregate MUST begin with `{aggregate_singular}_initiated_v{N}`**

This event is the "birth" of the aggregate — it marks the moment the process began.

| ✅ Correct | Aggregate |
|-----------|-----------|
| `venture_initiated_v1` | Venture |
| `division_initiated_v1` | Division |
| `order_initiated_v1` | Order |
| `claim_initiated_v1` | Insurance Claim |
| `project_initiated_v1` | Project |

### Why "Initiated"?

- **Business verb** — "We initiated a new project" is natural language
- **Process-oriented** — signals the START of a lifecycle, not just creation of data
- **Consistent** — one word for all aggregates, easy to search/grep
- **Not CRUD** — avoids the banned "created/updated/deleted" vocabulary

### The Pattern

```erlang
%% First event in any aggregate stream
#{
    event_type => <<"venture_initiated_v1">>,
    stream_id => <<"venture-abc123">>,
    data => #{
        venture_id => <<"abc123">>,
        name => <<"macula-geo">>,
        brief => <<"Geo-restriction for compliance">>,
        initiated_by => <<"human:rl">>,
        initiated_at => 1707350400000
    }
}
```

### Checklist

When creating a new aggregate:
- [ ] First event is `{aggregate}_initiated_v1`
- [ ] Event includes `initiated_by` (who/what started it)
- [ ] Event includes `initiated_at` (timestamp)
- [ ] Handler validates "not already initiated" before accepting

## 🔥 Auto-Creating Child Aggregates on Parent Initiation

**Date:** 2026-02-08
**Origin:** Venture → Division architecture discussion

### The Antipattern

Assuming that when a parent aggregate is initiated, child aggregates should be automatically created.

**Example (WRONG):**
```
venture_initiated_v1
    → listener subscribes
    → automatically creates division
```

This assumes:
- Every venture needs exactly one division
- The relationship is 1:1 and automatic
- No human/agent decision is needed

**Reality:** A venture might need 0, 1, 5, or 10 divisions. This is a deliberate decision, not an automatic consequence.

### The Rule

> **Parent aggregates DISCOVER children. Child aggregates INITIATE themselves.**

The parent owns the "what exists" decision. The child owns its lifecycle.

### The Correct Flow

```
1. venture_initiated_v1          # Venture exists
2. division_discovered_v1        # Venture decides "I need a division called X"
   → emitted to mesh
3. division_initiated_v1         # Division service starts X's lifecycle
```

### Semantic Distinction

| Action | Owner | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Discover** | Parent (venture) | "This parent will have a child called X" |
| **Initiate** | Child (division) | "Start the lifecycle of X" |

### Why It Matters

- **Flexibility** — Parent can have 0..N children
- **Explicit decisions** — Humans/agents choose what children exist
- **Proper DDD** — Parent aggregate owns its children's identities
- **Separation of concerns** — Identity vs lifecycle are different responsibilities

### The Lesson

> **Skip DnA phase → Make wrong assumptions → Build wrong architecture → Waste time fixing**

This mistake happened because we jumped to implementation without understanding the domain.

## 🔥 Direct Creation Endpoints for Child Aggregates

**Date:** 2026-02-09
**Origin:** Division API architecture review

### The Antipattern

Exposing a direct "create" or "initiate" API endpoint for child aggregates that should only exist through their parent.

**Example (WRONG):**
```
POST /api/divisions/initiate
{
  "name": "My Division",
  "description": "..."
}
```

This bypasses the domain flow:
- Divisions should only exist because a venture discovered them
- Direct creation allows orphan divisions (no parent venture)
- Violates the parent-child aggregate pattern

### The Rule

> **Child aggregates should NOT have direct creation endpoints. They're created through parent discovery.**

### The Correct Flow

1. **Parent discovers child**: `POST /api/ventures/:venture_id/divisions/discover`
2. **Event emitted**: `division_discovered_v1` to pg (internal) + mesh (external)
3. **Listener receives**: `subscribe_to_division_discovered` in design_division
4. **Policy decides**: `on_division_discovered_maybe_initiate_division`
5. **Child initiated**: `division_initiated_v1` event created

### When to Use Which

| Aggregate Type | Creation Endpoint? | Why |
|----------------|-------------------|-----|
| **Root aggregate** | Yes | Venture, Order, User — top-level entities |
| **Child aggregate** | No | Division, OrderLine — created via parent |

### API Design Pattern

```erlang
%% GOOD: Parent creates children through relationship
POST /api/ventures/:venture_id/divisions/discover

%% BAD: Direct creation of child
POST /api/divisions/initiate    % REMOVE THIS
```

### Testing Implications

When testing the walking skeleton:
- **Respect the domain flow** — Don't bypass event-driven creation with direct APIs
- **Test the full path** — Parent → Event → Listener → Child
- **If it doesn't work** — Fix the event flow, don't add a shortcut API

### The Lesson

> **API endpoints should reflect domain operations, not CRUD convenience.**

If you need to create test data, use the proper flow or seed the event store directly.
